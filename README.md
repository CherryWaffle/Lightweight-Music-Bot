# A Discord Music Bot written in JavaScript and the discord.js v13 library [ Forked from Galnir's Master-bot](https://github.com/galnir/Master-Bot)

## ðŸš§ The bot is transitioning from discord.js v12 to v13 so you may encounter bugs ðŸš§

## System dependencies

For the bot to run, your system needs to have Node.js v16 atleast and Python 3 (for compiling some Node.js module dependencies) installed.
A MongoDB database is also needed. I recommend using the free tier of MongoDB Atlas, you can get started using this [guide](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/). Make sure to generate a valid URI and place it in the .env file.

### Installing the Node.js dependencies

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project's folder and run the command `npm ci --production` to install all Node.js module dependencies.

## Setup

Create a `config.json` file in the root directory of the project with the following content : 

### Client ID

Client ID needs to be set for the bot to work.

```json
{
  "client_id": "the-bots-discord-id"
}
```

### Setting up the .env file

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project with the following contents :

```env
TOKEN=<Your Bot Token Here>
mongo_URI=<Your Mongo URI here>
```
These are the settings that need to be set for the music part of the bot to work.

Important Note
- Remember to enable **Privileged Gateway Intents** for the bot work properly !
- Remember to `Check` the `applications.commands` in the `Scope` tab of your discord application
- I have attached photos for referrence ðŸ˜„
